Numerous geodynamic and geophysical studies consider both the seafloor depth and
the seafloor crustal age. `EarthByte <https://www.earthbyte.org/>`_ has pioneered
the creation of crustal age grids since 1997 and we offer their latest version for
remote use in GMT.

Usage
~~~~~

You access a global crustal age grid by specifying the special name

   @earth_age[_\ *rru*\ [_\ *reg*\ ]]

The following codes for *rr*\ *u* and the optional *reg* are supported (dimensions and sizes are listed
for pixel-registered grids; gridline-registered grids increment dimensions by one):

.. _tbl-earth_age:

Note that resolutions 05m and higher are tiled.
See :gmt-docs:`Remote Data Sets <datasets/remote-data.html>` for more information.

See :gmt-docs:`GMT remote dataset usage <datasets/remote-data.html#usage>` for when resolution codes are optional or required.
All of these data will, when downloaded, be placed in your ~/.gmt/server directory, with
the earth_age files being placed in an ``earth/earth_age`` sub-directory. If you do not
specify a CPT, the default CPT for this dataset (*@earth_age.cpt*) will be used.

Technical Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We scale and reformat the original data to take up very little space so that downloads
from the servers are as fast as possible. For the seafloor crustal age grid this means
we chose 0.01 Myr as the smallest data unit, which is well below the uncertainties in the
model. Data are scaled and shifted to fit in a short integer grid that is highly compressed
by netCDF lossless compression and chunking. The data are reported in Myr relative
to the 2012 Geological Time Scale.
